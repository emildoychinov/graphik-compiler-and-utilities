//The structure is a little outdated as of 27.12.2020
//An update is to be made soon enough.

#Guide:
	- "..." -> May be more than one.
	- "|" -> May be one thing or another.
	- If a node member is used in more than one node,
	its type would not be specified again in its second
	occurance.

Program:
	Function ...	<- "Struct"	

Function:
	Ident = "String"
	Args = "none" | ...
	Block = "Struct"

Block:
	Statement ... 	<- "Struct"

Statement:
	If statement = "Struct"
	While loop = "Struct"
	Variable definition = "Struct"
	Assignment = "Struct"

If statement:
	Expression(codition) = "Struct"
	Block

While loop:
	Expression(codition)
	Block

Variable definition:
	Ident
	Expression

Assignment:
	Offset = "Uint"
	Expression

Expression:
	Value1 = "Int", Value2 = "Int"
	Offset1, Offset2
	Operation = "Struct"
	Left side = "Expression"
	Right side = "Expression"

Operation:
	Arithmetic
	Logical

Arithmetic:
	Addition
	Subtraction
	Multiplication
	Division

Logical:
	And
	Or
	Greater than(or equal to)
	Less than(or equal to)
	Equal
