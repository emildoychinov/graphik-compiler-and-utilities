# graphik-compiler-and-utilities
This is the official repository of the Graphik Utility Package(GUP). It includes the Graphik programming language, which I specified based on a previous project(namely Flex++), the Graphik Lightweight Compiler(GLC), which compiles Graphik source code down to x64 Assembly, and the Graphik Graphical Calculator(GGC).
