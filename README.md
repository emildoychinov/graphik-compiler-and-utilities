# Graphík Utility Package
This is the official repository of the Graphík Utility Package(GUP). It includes the Graphík programming language, which I specified based on a previous project(namely Flex++), the Graphík Lightweight Compiler(GLC), which compiles Graphík source code down to x64 Assembly, and the Graphík Graphical Calculator(GGC).
